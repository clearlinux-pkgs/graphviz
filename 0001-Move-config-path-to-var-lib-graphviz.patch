Subject: [PATCH] Move config path to /var/lib/graphviz

The previous config path was in a stateless dir and the config is
needed to be updated after every swupd action potentially so move it
to a statedir instead. Note this will need to be run after creation of
tmpfiles as the config file creation doesn't create directories if
needed.

Also add the tmpfiles configuration for creation the directory.
